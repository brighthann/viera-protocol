Viera Protocol
Decentralized Research Funding with AI-Powered Validation
Viera Protocol is a blockchain-based platform that revolutionizes research funding through milestone-based payments, AI validation, and automated decision-making. The protocol replaces traditional bureaucratic funding processes with a transparent, efficient, and bias-reduced system.
/////Core Features of the platform:
Automated Payments: AI validation triggers instant payments for high-confidence submissions (85%+)
Milestone-Based Funding: Escrow-secured funding released upon validation
AI-Powered Validation: Multi-layer analysis including security, quality, and originality assessment
Bias Reduction: Anonymized review process with algorithmic fairness
Decentralized Oracle Network: Consensus-based validation results
Open Source: Transparent algorithms and community governance
/////System Architecture:
Smart contract: The Polygon-based smart contracts are built with Solidity
Oracle Bridge: Node.js service
AI Validation: Python FastAPI service
Frontend: React application
Storage: IPFS for decentralized file storage
Security: Integrated security scanner
/////Prerequisites:
Node.js
Python
Docker
Git
/////Tech stack:
#Blockchain:      Solidity: Smart contract development
                  Hardhat: Development framework
                  OpenZeppelin: Security libraries
                  Polygon: Layer-2 scaling solution 
#Machine learning / AI integration:       Python: AI service development. 
                                          FastAPI: HTTP API framework
                                          ClamAV: Malware detection
                                          Bandit/ESLint: Security analysis
                                          Pylint/Flake8: Code quality analysis
NOTE: THE SYSTEM MAKES USE OF BASIC PYTHON LIBRARIES INSTEAD OF DEEP LEARNING FRAMEWORKS LIKE PYTORCH OR TENSORFLOW BECAUSE OF MAJOR DETERMINING FACTORS LIKE: Unavailabilty of training datasets that are required by deep learning models. Cost and complexity of training deep learning models. etc.

#Infrastructure:        Docker: Containerization
                        IPFS: Decentralized storage
                        Node.js: Oracle bridge service
                        Winston: Logging
#Validation process:        Researcher submits milestone deliverables to IPFS
                            Smart contract creates validation request
                            Oracle bridge fetches files and sends to AI service
                            AI validation analyzes security, quality, and originality
                            Confidence scoring determines approval path; approval paths come in three grade stages.
                                -85-100%: Automatic approval â†’ Instant payment
                                -70-84%: Human review required
                                -0-69%: Rejection or dispute process
#Security Features:         Multi-layer validation: Security scanning, code analysis, bias detection
                            Economic security: Oracle staking and slashing mechanisms
                            Privacy protection: Anonymized submissions, no PII storage
                            Audit trail: Complete transaction history on blockchain
                            Emergency controls: Pausable contracts, multi-sig governance
